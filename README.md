Welcome to my GitHub repository! Below you'll find a categorised list of projects I've worked on. Feel free to explore them.


# My Projects

## Dissertation
#### Analysis of Opioid Analgesic Prescriptions in England; Significant Features and Identification of Local Tier Authority Residual Outliers utilising Linear Regression
- **Description:** My dissertation analysed England's opioid epidemic using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques applied to big data. This involved handling unclean datasets, employing stepwise regression for variable refinement, using random forests and deep neural networks to address missing values, conducting multivariate linear modelling for feature analysis, and performing linear regression with residual analysis to derive meaningful insights.

## Machine Learning

### Computer Vision

#### Binary Computer Vision Classification: Exploring CNNs, Xception, and MobileNetV2 Models

- **Description:** This project explores the use of various deep learning architectures, from basic CNNs to advanced transfer learning models like MobileNetV2, to accurately classify images as either cats or dogs. It emphasises the importance of data preprocessing, model selection, and fine-tuning in improving classification performance.

#### Binary MRI Classification for Brain Tumor Detection Using Transfer Learning with ImageNet

- **Description:** Transfer learning with ImageNet pre-trained models to classify brain MRI images for tumor detection. Two approaches were explored: a base model without fine-tuning and a fine-tuned model. Both achieved high accuracy and F1-scores, with fine-tuning reducing errors and delivering more robust predictions.
